 * KERNEL FEATURES
 *
 * Features are statically-linked, dynamically initialised modules built 
 * in to the kernel. They provide basic functionality such as console IO,
 * interrupt handling and so forth - most of which are architecture 
 * dependent, and many of which don't apply to all architectures. 
 * 
 * Handling them in this way means that the kernel is more maintainable,
 * and it's easy to add new modules for different architectures. It also
 * means that the architecture-agnostic code in kmain doesn't need any
 * architecture-specific calls, and doesn't need to make a ton of calls
 * to architecture specific methods, which would just be stubbed on other
 * architectures.
 *
 * Obviously we could just have a catch-all 'init_arch' in the HAL, but
 * that would mean we'd just be handing over control. It might also be
 * less portable...
 *
 * This is actually based on James Malloy's code from his JMTK. He calls
 * features 'modules'. I avoided that to avoid confusion with loadable
 * modules.
